# simple-exponentiation
The simple module that helps you with exponentiation.
Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as bn, involving two numbers, the base b and the exponent n. When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, bn is the product of multiplying n bases:

{\displaystyle b^{n}=\underbrace {b\times \cdots \times b} _{n}} b^{n}=\underbrace {b\times \cdots \times b} _{n}

In that case, bn is called the n-th power of b, or b raised to the power n.
